This workspace is a static website for a student career journey, with 5 independent HTML pages (Interest Quiz, Diploma Matcher, Polytechnic Comparison, Course Path, Motivation & Careers). Each page is static HTML with its own chatbot/avatar embed, no shared JS or backend, and all logical dependencies are handled by user copy-paste of fixed-format text blocks.
